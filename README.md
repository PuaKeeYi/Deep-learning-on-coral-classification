# Implementing Deep Learning Technique in Coral Classification (Bleached Coral and Healthy Coral)

## Introduction
This project uses Deep Learning (CNN with TensorFlow) to classify bleached vs. healthy coral from images. It aims to provide an AI-powered tool for detecting coral bleaching to help on observing the marine environment.

## Description (how to use)
This project is a mechine learning project which have done the work of image data preprocessing, model selection, model training model tunning to get the optimal model for the classification. The chosen models are trained and save as h5 file. The optimal model is the CNN model and it is used for the app building.
